longBio: |
  Hey there! I'm Prannay, Ex-Founder of Writee AI - an AI-based copywriting platform that helps businesses produce content better, faster and easier. Currently I am pursuing my Bachelors in Chemical Engineering at Jadavpur University, Kolkata. Being a builder, I had to become what people call a specialised generalist. That is to say I know a little about a lot of things while being in the constant pursuit of learning more along the way.

  I'm a devout believer in the audacity of thought - so if you've got an idea too big for the world to digest, count me in. My core competencies lie in copywriting, full stack development, data science, finance and everything product centric. When not working on my startup, you can find me humming Indian Classical Music, venturing out to take the occasional photograph or just lying on my bed binge-watching the latest TV show on Netflix. Hit me up if you want to discuss any potential business ideas, learn more about Writee or just chat over a cup of coffee.
