          Hey there! Iâ€™m Prannay, CEO & Co-Founder of Writee AI - an AI-based
          copywriting platform that helps businesses produce content better,
          faster and easier. Currently I am pursuing my Bachelors in Chemical
          Engineering at Jadavpur University, Kolkata. Being an entrepreneur, I
          had to become what people call a specialised generalist. That is to
          say I know a little about a lot of things while being in the constant
          pursuit of learning more along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a devout believer in the audacity of thought - so if you've got an
          idea too big for the world to digest, count me in. My core
          competencies lie in copywriting, full stack development, data science,
          finance and everything product centric. When not working on my
          startup, you can find me humming Indian Classical Music, venturing out
          to take the occasional photograph or just lying on my bed
          binge-watching the latest TV show on Netflix. Hit me up if you want to
          discuss any potential business ideas, learn more about Writee
          (founders live and breathe their start-ups) or just chat over a cup of
          coffee.
